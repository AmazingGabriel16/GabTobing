<div id="about-me">
Hey,<br><br>
Me smol developer, or at least a wannabe developer. Me study computer science so me have big brain in computer and science.<br><br>
Me love spend time in anime, and me love to...<br><br>
Idk why I even created this, I created this in the morning on a saturday again... This is why sleep is important!<br><br>
But hey, I’m gabs and this is my smol website. I am a 3rd year computer science student majoring in artifiical intelligence because I’ve been sent by Cyberlife, yes, not AI for data, AI for creating actual people XD<br><br>
On my spare time I like to develop some fun code stuff, watch anime, play games such as Paladins (because I’m too poor to afford Overwatch, and also because it has jiggle physics), do some art and yeah! :D
