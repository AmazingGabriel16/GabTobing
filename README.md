# Gab's home website

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my website.

All of the pages should be in the main directory and not in a file, the resources(assessts) for those pages and all pages would be located inside clearly labelled folders, such as the images and js folder.

A note to anybody reading this, this website is still under development and will take a while.
I will try my best to update it and actually finish the website, but for now it is incomplete by a lot and I'm taking it step by step.

Thank you for your patience.
